To use GDB, you'll have to compile with debugging information enabled. Do this by adding the -g switch on the compilation command line. If you're using a Makefileas described previously, you can just set CFLAGSequal to -gwhen you run make, as shown here:
% make CFLAGS=-g 
gcc -g -c main.c 
g++ -g -c reciprocal.cpp 
g++ -g -o reciprocal main.o reciprocal.o
